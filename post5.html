				Orangutans have high cognitive abilities comparable to the other great apes. This high level of intelligence manifests itself in tool-use and even the making of simple tools in the wild. Orangutans have been observed making simple tools to scratch themselves. They also use leafy branches to shelter themselves from rain and sun, and sometimes even drape large leaves over themselves like a poncho. They have also been observed using branches as tools during insect foraging, honey collection, and protection against stinging insects, and to ‚Äúfish‚Äù for branches or fruit that is out of reach.

				ModuPipe is a modular screw system of differently shaped plexiglass tubes designed to feed Orangutans. The different modules can be joined together to form individual tubes of different shape and lengths and can be freely distributed in the enclosure. Orangutans are the largest arboreal animal on the planet. Most of their lives are spent in trees where they travel from branch to branch by climbing, clambering, and brachiating. In order to encourage this behaviour, MonuPipe should be three-dimensionally integrated into the enclosures. In addition to the tubes, the set consists of thin wooden rods, wooden boards and one or more feeding trays. The basic idea is to move the tray through the tubes using a wooden rod and boards until the bowl reaches the end of the tube.In addition to the tubes, the set consists of thin wooden rods, wooden boards and one or more feeding trays.

				Each tube module has a vertical slot and a horizontal slot, respectively, adapted to the moulding line. The wooden rod is passed through the vertical slot and inserted through a ring attached to the feeding tray. Now the feeding tray can be moved through the tube following the slot line. To secure the tray and prevent it from returning to its original position, the boards can be inserted into the horizontal slots. The tray is now secured and the user can proceed to the next module - until the tray reaches the end of the pipe system and its contents can be eaten.

				The advantage of Plexiglas tubes is that they are very cheap industrial products, available in large numbers and around the world. In addition, it is a very light material, which ensures universal applicability (the tubes can easily be suspended) and reduces the risk of injury. The material also makes it possible to modify the system without any great mechanical or manual effort and to introduce different levels of difficulty in order to constantly present users with new challenges. ModuPipe can easily be applied to enclosures of other primate species.
